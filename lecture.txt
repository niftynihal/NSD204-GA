CI / CD

Continuous Integration



Continuous Deployment


new_code --> {code_formatter} ---> {run test cases} --> existing_code --> {run test cases} --> deploy/redeploy;


CI/CD we can : 

1. Automate software development workflows
2. Automate repetitive tasks


Github Actions - It's a CI/CD platform by github.


Github repo 
1. create a new repo;
2. set that up as a origin


YAML - Yet Another Markup language/YAML Ain't Markup language


Rules in YAML

1. It followed indentation (specific blocks of spaces or tabs)
2. YML files use key-value pairs
3. When there are multiple values, they are denoted by hyphen and space and the value;
        - value1
        - value2
4. comments are denoted by #



The runs in the job happen sequentially,

**If one of the job fails, the subsequent jobs won't get executed**

1. run code formatter
2. run test cases // for example if test case fails, the next step that is deployment won't be executed
3. deploy it
